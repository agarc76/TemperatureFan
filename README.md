# Assistant Temperature Fan
This project is a AI assisted fan. It begins with the user entering a room, or in our case, pressing a button and turning on the led light. Then the system would use Text to Speech to ask the user if they want the fan to be turned on. The user should then answer with "Yes" or "No". Later designs of our system should allow the fan to turn on depending on the temperature inside the room and turn on the light using motion sensor.
